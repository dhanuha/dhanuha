🔐 I recently earned the CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) certification, strengthening my foundation in cybersecurity principles and best practices.
🧪 Currently, I’m gaining hands-on lab experience by working through the TryHackMe SOC Level 1 pathway to sharpen my practical SOC skills.
📊 I’m learning SOC workflows such as incident detection, log analysis, and working with SIEM tools, preparing myself to excel as a SOC Analyst.
🤝 I’m open to collaborating on cybersecurity projects related to threat monitoring, threat hunting, and incident response.
🚀 I’m actively looking for entry-level opportunities as a SOC Analyst, where I can contribute to threat detection, vulnerability assessments, and security operations while continuing to grow in the field.
🛠️ I have hands-on experience with security testing, including clickjacking, SQL injection attacks, and using tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and Nmap.
